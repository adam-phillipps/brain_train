This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


So...for realz, B, this is just a test sandboxery app.  go ahead and screw around with 
all the things.  just be polite and put it back together again, if you plan on merging
to master.
